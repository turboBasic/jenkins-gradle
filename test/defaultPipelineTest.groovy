/*

First off, we create a variable to hold our runnable pipeline (script).
We then see a setup method which is run before each test (feature method).
(Read more about Spock terminology [here](http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.3/spock_primer.html))
The cleanup method is run after each test. Finally, thereâ€™s the void 'Happy
flow'() {} which is the actual test (or Feature Method as Spock likes to call it).
This test uses the when -> then style of testing, and just calls the pipeline
with a default set of parameters and validates the outcome.
